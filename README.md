# seqcli

A test at developing a basic grid and channel-based light show sequencer using ncurses + C99.

**Notes**

- The application currently doesn't use ncurses' windows model, although it would likely benefit from it
- Keybindings use both named definitions from ncurses and magic numbers for macOS support
- This implements several basic UI elements, and offers no accessibility or shortcut support
